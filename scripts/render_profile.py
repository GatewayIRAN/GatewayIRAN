"""render_profile.py - generate the GatewayIRAN profile face from live data (T-011).

This replaces the hand-written profile README. The face is a view of the whole
account, rebuilt from the GitHub API on a schedule and committed back to the
profile repository. The owner never edits it by hand: a new project enters the
face on its own and a stale one leaves on its own.

Owner rules enforced here (A-0044), and re-enforced by
checks/check_profile_face.py so a future edit cannot quietly break them:

  1  no single language, stack, platform, protocol or licence is named
  2  no specific project is named directly - top projects are derived from
     the API each run, linked and labelled
  3  no fixed number standing for a quantity that varies in reality: every
     number printed is a value fetched during this run
  4  English only
  5  every line describes the whole account, not one project

Usage
  python scripts/render_profile.py [--root DIR] [--write] [--json]
                                   [--fixture PATH]

  --write     write the face - README.md plus assets/stats.svg and the
              banner's fact pills - into the face directory this checkout
              carries: content/profile/ in the kit workspace, the repository
              root in the profile repository (which is where GitHub renders
              it). Default: dry run, prints to stdout, writes nothing
  --json      print the fetched facts as JSON to stdout, for debugging
  --fixture   read the API responses from a recorded JSON file instead of the
              network. Used by the offline self-check and by CI when the
              network is unavailable. Must contain the same shape the fetcher
              returns.

Credentials (decision D-014): the token is read from the environment
(GITHUB_TOKEN, as GitHub Actions provides it) or from git's credential
helper in a subprocess. It is never placed in argv, never written to a file,
never logged, and never echoed. If no token is found the generator still runs
against the public API at a lower rate limit, which is enough for this
account.

Exit codes: 0 wrote or would-write, 1 fetch or render failure, 2 usage.
